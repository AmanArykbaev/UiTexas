Basic UI test in https://www.saucedemo.com.

I am using my hybrid framework and also you will see cucumber html report.

Unfortunately I did not have to much time for complex testing. 

Mannualy Test cases:

Verify that cursor is focused on “Username” text box on the page load (login page)

Verify that the login screen contains elements such as Username, Password, Sign in button.

Verify that tab functionality is working properly or not.

Verify that Enter/Tab key works as a substitute for the Sign in button.

Verify that all the fields such as Username, Password has a valid placeholder

Verify that User is able to Login with Valid Credentials

Verify that User is not able to Login with invalid Username and invalid Password

Verify that User is not able to Login with Valid Username and invalid Password

Verify that User is not able to Login with invalid Username and Valid Password

Verify that User is not able to Login with blank Username or Password
